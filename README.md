Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project

This is the repo of the Write a Data Science Blog Post project for the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project.

1- Business Understanding

We investigated which developer and non developer are more satisfied with their job.  

For this we need to understand what can be the category for developers as there are multiple skills which are utilised by developers and on the other hand non developers can also be categorised. we also need to understand whihc profession is more in interesting and benefitial with respect to career growth.

There are 3 folowing questions:
- Which developer has the highest salary?
- Which developer has the highest career satisfaction?
- which non developer has the highest career satisfaction?

2- Data Understanding

There are lots of information from the stack overflow survey. we focused on specific information and gathered the data which can help to analyse our findings.

3- Prepare Data

we cleaned the data, filter the rows and split and trim the data for our requirement.

4- Data Modeling

we graphed different behaviours that were relevant to the 3 questions, with the python libraries matplotlib and seaborn.

5- Evaluate the Results


for the 3 questions, we arrived at the following conclusions:
- Which developer has the highest salary? developers who have not mentioned their skill. whereas among the identified skills, Admin has highest salary
- Which developer has the highest career satisfaction? Admins are more satisfied with their job
- which non developer has the highest career satisfaction? Educators are more interested for their job.



The blog is written on the following [link](https://ritijj-nanodegree.blogspot.com/2024/08/career-satisfaction-for-developer-and.html)


Finally, the readme format:

- the libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Non developer salaries are not prepsent in the survey so, did not find the comparison of salaries between developer and non developer.
- overall, Educators are more satified with their job among the all professionals (either developer or non developer)
